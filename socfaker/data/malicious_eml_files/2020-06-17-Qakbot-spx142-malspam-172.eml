I told Janis that time was too early for me. I know Carol, Rita and Donna are driving together. I'll try to call you , Carol, when you get home to see what time you're leaving and whether I could possibly ride to Sea Island with you. Not a problem if too crowded or time doesn't work.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u><b>to bring</b></u>:&nbsp; there is a Publix right outside of the Cloisters, so we're not in a bind. I plan to go to Sam's and get a couple bottles of wine, popcorn, and a few big bottles of purified water to drink.&nbsp; (I think the size is gallons).&nbsp; So bring your drinking containers. Janis has cheese, crackers for snacks. Either breakfast or munchies goodies may be good. Again, we have our wonderful Publix close to us. <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div class="ydp607b109csignature">Colleen</div></div></div></div></blockquote></div></blockquote></body></html></blockquote>
