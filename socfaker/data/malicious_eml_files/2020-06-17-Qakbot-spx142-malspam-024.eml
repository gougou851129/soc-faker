Meghan McCain responded Tuesday to the latest fight she and Whoopi Goldberg got into on The View. The co-hosts were discussing the impeachment process on Monday's show, and McCain was trying to explain that, politically, it could be a bad move for the Democrats.

After one exchange, Goldberg told McCain to just "stop talking." She did, but on Tuesday, she responded on Twitter. "Good morning - to all the fellow conservative 'girls' who won’t be quiet," she tweeted alongside an image of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons.

Also Tuesday, sources told Page Six that producers had to step in to calm things down during the commercial break, as there was still an hour of the show left.



McCain had also noted Monday, "Pointing out things that are true is part of my job even if it angers people and even if it’s politically inconvenient," later adding, "Pretending half the country doesn't exist won't make them disappear. The culture war is real, and Americans who aren't part of the overwhelmingly anti-conservative media deserve to have their views represented." She also got support from others, including conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who tweeted, "Nothing says tolerance and diversity like Whoopi Goldberg telling Meghan McCain to shut up after McCain says literally *a* sentence about the political fallout from impeachment. So much sisterhood from Goldberg."

The "far-left" evangelicals are out to get Trump. That's from the president himself, who didn't take kindly to an editorial this week by Mark Galli, editor-in-chief of leading evangelical magazine Christianity Today. In it, Galli calls Trump a "leader of grossly immoral character" who should be removed from office, either by "the Senate or by popular vote next election." Trump was up early Friday to offer his thoughts on the magazine, which was founded by Billy Graham, and its stance.

"A far left magazine, or very 'progressive,' as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn't been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call," he tweeted, apparently referring to his July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president.



The president added the magazine "would rather have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion & your guns, than Donald Trump as your President. No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and it's not even close." He ended with: "I won't be reading ET again!"—a likely typo that prompted jokes about how Trump was referring to Evangelical Today, Entertainment Tonight, or even the Spielberg movie alien.

Graham's son, Franklin Graham, who has no ties to Christianity Today, tells the Washington Post that even though he hasn't read the editorial, he knows his father wouldn't have approved of it.

"He would've been very embarrassed that the magazine he started would call for something like this when there are no crimes committed," Graham said. "It's a totally different magazine than what he started."
the Social Security Administration announces the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). By law, federal benefits increase when the cost of living rises, as measured by the Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Usually, there is an increase in the benefit amount people will receive each month, starting the following January.

Nearly 69 million Americans will see a 1.6 percent increase in their Social Security benefits and SSI payments in 2020.

Other changes that will happen in January 2020 reflect the increase in the national average wage index. For example, the maximum amount of earnings subject to Social Security payroll tax will increase to $137,700 from $132,900. The earnings limit for workers who are younger than "full" retirement age (age 66 for people born in 1943 through 1954) will increase to $18,240. (SS deducts $1 from benefits for each $2 earned over $18,240.)

The earnings limit for people turning 66 in 2020 will increase to $48,600. (SS deducts $1 from benefits for each $3 earned over $48,600 until the month the worker turns age 66.)

In December 2019, SS will post Social Security COLA notices online for retirement, survivors, and disability beneficiaries who have a my Social Security account. You will be able to view and save future COLA notices via the Message Center inside my Social Security.

You can log in to or sign up for a my Social Security account today at www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount to get more information about your new benefit amount.

You can choose to receive an electronic notification by email, text, or both ways under "Message Center Preferences."
