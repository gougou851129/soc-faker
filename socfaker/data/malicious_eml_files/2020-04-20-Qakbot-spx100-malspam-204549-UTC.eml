	Hi Linda,</p>=0D
<p>=0D
	As discussed I have adjusted Hannah&#39;s term 2 fees to reflect the cla=
sses that she missed throughout the term being 8. This has resulted in th=
e fee being reduced from $330 to $210.</p>=0D
<p>=0D
	You can either make weekly payments of $26.25 commencing on the 1/8/15 o=
r fortnightly payments of $52.50 commencing 8/8/15. These payments can be=
 made direct to our bank account 033-602 257701.</p>=0D
<p>=0D
	We again apologise for this oversight.</p>=0D
