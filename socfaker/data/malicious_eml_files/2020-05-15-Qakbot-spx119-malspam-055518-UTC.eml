> U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ANNOUNCES TWO NEW INITIATIVES AIMEDAT PROMOTIN=
G HIRING OF VETERANS AND APPLICANTS WITH DISABILITIES =EF=BF=BD The U.S. =
Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFC=
CP) today unveiled two initiatives aimed at promoting the hiring of veter=
ans and protecting the rights of applicants with disabilities: The Good F=
aith Initiative for Veterans Employment (G-FIVE) and Ensuring the Accessi=
bility of Online Application Systems.WASHINGTON =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD "The G=
-FIVE was created to address the employment challenges facing the veteran=
 workforce today by recognizing federal contractors for their efforts in =
employing and advancing covered veterans," said Charles E. James Sr., dep=
uty assistant secretary for OFCCP. "It reaffirms OFCCP's commitment to en=
sure compliance with the requirements of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjus=
tment Assistance Act and creates an excellent incentive for federal contr=
actors to hire veterans." "The G-FIVE also strengthens partnerships betwe=
en OFCCP and veterans groups and other agencies," added Victoria Lipnic, =
assistant secretary of labor for employment standards. "It's an OFCCP ini=
tiative that supports America's heroes." The second initiative, Ensuring =
the Accessibility of Online Application Systems, is designed to ensure th=
at federal contractors and subcontractors provide equal opportunity to qu=
alified applicants with disabilities, including disabled veterans, to com=
pete for jobs when using an online application system. Electronic job app=
lication systems must be accessible to, and usable by, applicants who hav=
e disabilities, or the contractor must provide a reasonable accommodation=
 that allows an equal opportunity to compete for a job. "Nothing is more =
fundamental to equal employment opportunity than the opportunity to apply=
 for a job," said James. "As more and more employers turn to the Internet=
 to locate and screen job applicants, this initiative is crucial to ensur=
ing that disabled veterans and other qualified individuals with disabilit=
ies are afforded that opportunity when an online system is used." The dir=
ectives outlining these new initiatives, along with frequently asked ques=
tions, are available on OFCCP's Web site at.www.dol.gov/ofccp/ OFCCP, an =
agency of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration, =
enforces Executive Order 11246 and other laws that prohibit employment di=
scrimination by federal contractors. The agency monitors federal contract=
ors to ensure that they provide equal employment opportunities without re=
gard to race, gender, color, religion, national origin, disability or vet=
eran status. Archived News Release =EF=BF=BD Caution: Information may be =

CES TWO NEW INITIATIVES AIMEDAT PROMOTING HIRING OF VETERANS AND APPLICAN=
TS WITH DISABILITIES =A0 The U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal=
 Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) today unveiled two initiatives aime=
d at promoting the hiring of veterans and protecting the rights of applic=
ants with disabilities: The Good Faith Initiative for Veterans Employment=
 (G-FIVE) and Ensuring the Accessibility of Online Application Systems.WA=
SHINGTON =97=A0 "The G-FIVE was created to address the employment challen=
ges facing the veteran workforce today by recognizing federal contractors=
 for their efforts in employing and advancing covered veterans," said Cha=
rles E. James Sr., deputy assistant secretary for OFCCP. "It reaffirms OF=
CCP's commitment to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Vietna=
m Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act and creates an excellent incen=
tive for federal contractors to hire veterans." "The G-FIVE also strength=
ens partnerships between OFCCP and veterans groups and other agencies," a=
dded Victoria Lipnic, assistant secretary of labor for employment standar=
ds. "It's an OFCCP initiative that supports America's heroes." The second=
 initiative, Ensuring the Accessibility of Online Application Systems, is=
 designed to ensure that federal contractors and subcontractors provide e=
qual opportunity to qualified applicants with disabilities, including dis=
abled veterans, to compete for jobs when using an online application syst=
em. Electronic job application systems must be accessible to, and usable =
by, applicants who have disabilities, or the contractor must provide a re=
asonable accommodation that allows an equal opportunity to compete for a =
job. "Nothing is more fundamental to equal employment opportunity than th=
e opportunity to apply for a job," said James. "As more and more employer=
s turn to the Internet to locate and screen job applicants, this initiati=
ve is crucial to ensuring that disabled veterans and other qualified indi=
viduals with disabilities are afforded that opportunity when an online sy=
stem is used." The directives outlining these new initiatives, along with=
 frequently asked questions, are available on OFCCP's Web site at.www.dol=
..gov/ofccp/ OFCCP, an agency of the Department of Labor's Employment Stan=
dards Administration, enforces Executive Order 11246 and other laws that =
prohibit employment discrimination by federal contractors. The agency mon=
itors federal contractors to ensure that they provide equal employment op=
portunities without regard to race, gender, color, religion, national ori=
gin, disability or veteran status. Archived News Release =97 Caution: Inf=

For federal contractors and subcontractors, affirmative action must be ta=
ken by covered employers to recruit and advance qualified minorities, wom=
en, persons with disabilities, and covered veterans. Affirmative actions =
include training programs, outreach efforts, and other positive steps. Th=
ese procedures should be incorporated into the companys written personnel=
 policies. Employers with written affirmative action programs must implem=
ent them, keep them on file and update=A0them annually.=A0Good Faith Effo=
