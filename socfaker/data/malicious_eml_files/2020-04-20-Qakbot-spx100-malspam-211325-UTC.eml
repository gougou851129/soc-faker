<div dir="ltr">Hello Keith , An update on the non believers,
<div>I have spoken to two of the committee other than, Henderson , Easton, &nbsp;Lott, &nbsp; McLay,[on holiday &nbsp;a Murphy follower ] &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Helen Tiehuis &nbsp;is hang up on Clause 4.2 , believes it is problem along with the Managers Contract .</div>
<div>Peter Callister, like his wife, he believes what they have been told about Clause 4.2 and Peter has read your letter, but quote &quot; he is does not live here so we don't take any notice of him&quot;.</div>
<div>I havn't spoken to Leonie Smith as yet , but she lives next to Callisters, and she listens to Easton .</div>
<div>Effectively there are only two members of the committee we could rely on Hopper and Steed.</div>
<div>We have three villagers ready to stand and we are looking for number 4.&nbsp; I can't stand because Jeanette and I are away on extended overseas travel from May1 to late Sept .</div>
<div>We have a problem, maybe we are looking at an Administrator.!!<br>
</div>
<div>I think the time &nbsp;has come, when we need to think about the next step.</div>
<div>I will ahve a take to Christine.</div>
<div>Regards</div>
<div>Barry</div>
