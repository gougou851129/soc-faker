<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">Well, we had a heck of a weekend.&nbsp; The entire family spent the day Saturday on our yacht (a 1992 15 foot Boston Whaler with a 1995 motor) tooling around Peconic Bay.&nbsp; Then a cold
 front came through and we were engulfed in a bank of fog.&nbsp; And I got lost.&nbsp; Totally lost.&nbsp; I unintentionally travelled from Peconic Bay to the Long Island Sound, and then I came out of the fog into a beautiful day and stared heading home – which is east.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately, however, I did not know I was in Long Island Sound, so heading east actually made me closer to home by land but further by sea.&nbsp; Then I noticed we were below a quarter tank of gas.&nbsp; And we ran out of gas (fortunately I saw it coming so I took
 us into a sheltered cove and anchored us).&nbsp; This was the first time I’ve used Sea Tow -- and it was very helpful!&nbsp; It was a great adventure but, man, did I feel foolish!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">On Sunday, I drove to our condo in Manhattan for the day to feed the fish and pick stuff up.&nbsp; Our neighborhood seems entirely untouched by last week’s activities.&nbsp; No plywood
 up at all.&nbsp; I drove east to west across Delancy Street and Houston Street, and saw a few boarded up windows on banks and drug stores, but no signs of damage or broken glass.&nbsp; I understand that in the heart of SoHo there was damage to some of the “fancy” stores
 – Burberry’s, Zara, Apple – but speculation is that this looting may have been done by pros and that much of it is on video.&nbsp; So we’ll see how the prosecutors do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">As to political stuff, I’m so tired of it.&nbsp; At this point there is nothing that either Trump or Biden could say – nothing – that would lead me to vote for any member of the Republican
 party in November.&nbsp; As a father, I hate the fact that Trump is out there each day acting as a role model and setting an example for my children.&nbsp; I hate that congressional Republicans refuse to condemn him.&nbsp; I fear that my 11 year old is watching him and thinking
 to herself that lying and bullying is a way to get ahead.&nbsp; It is horrible and depressing and it just keeps getting worse.&nbsp; For perhaps the very first time in my life, I will vote a straight democratic ballot in November in an attempt to kick these bums out
 of office, as my grandfather would have said.&nbsp; Every single one of them should be out on their butts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">Now, I do recognize that if I get my wish and every single Republican is voted out of office in November, the Democrats will likely abuse their new power, act like total fools,
 and drive me to the right for one or more future elections.&nbsp; I can live with that.&nbsp;
<u>These</u> Republicans just seem to have no moral compass at all and I want them punished for that.&nbsp; That way, in the future, the lesson will be remembered that one must have a moral compass in order to remain in office.&nbsp; Or so I hope.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">Anyway, you are asking the right questions, Uncle Phil, and pondering the right issues.&nbsp; But I’m not surprised because you are and always have been a good man.&nbsp; I hope that by
 November you too are fed up with this guy in the White House and that you too vote for Biden.&nbsp; Frankly, if Biden were in a terminal coma and Elizabeth Warren was the vice presidential nominee (which is a scenario that scares me to death and which I hate) I
 would enthusiastically vote for Biden in a coma.&nbsp; That is how dangerous I believe Trump to be to this country and what a horrible role model he is.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">Finally, on an entirely different topic, my understanding of “conservatism” is what William F. Buckley, Jr. espoused.&nbsp; It is all about looking to the past for guidance – sort
 of anti-progressive and anti-change agent.&nbsp; Most of his definitional writings were in the mid-1950s and were published in the National Review.&nbsp; Interestingly, he wrote a “Publisher’s Statement” in 1955 which may be viewed as implicating the current crisis:&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#202122;background:white">“The central question that emerges—and it is not a parliamentary question or a question that is answered by merely consulting a catalog of the
 rights of American citizens, born Equal—is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes—the
 White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#202122">National Review believes that the South's premises are correct. If the majority wills what is socially atavistic, then to thwart the majority may be, though undemocratic, enlightened.
 It is more important for any community, anywhere in the world, to affirm and live by civilized standards, than to bow to the demands of the numerical majority. Sometimes it becomes impossible to assert the will of a minority, in which case it must give way;
 and the society will regress; sometimes the numerical minority cannot prevail except by violence: then it must determine whether the prevalence of its will is worth the terrible price of violence.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">Not to put too fine a point in it, but the reason I’ve never viewed you or my parents as fitting Buckley’s definition is because you struggle with the right thing to do to make
 this country better, as opposed to looking to the past for guidance.&nbsp; I believe that both pieces are necessary to progress, but being backward looking is not alone sufficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">G’morning guys, it’s a beautiful Saturday morning in sunny California and we do count our blessings that at our age we are comfortable and secure.&nbsp; That is not by accident, it started with decisions I made as a teenager and throughout my
 life, to play by the rules, respect our values and institutions, work to change them if and when necessary.&nbsp; I have lived with and worked with people of different cultures, backgrounds and races and have provided them my respect and they have returned that
 respect.&nbsp; I expected them to also play by the rules, help change them if warranted, and respect our institutions, and those I know have done just that. I generally don’t like labels, but it helps to understand that &nbsp;I am a registered Republican, although I
 think I lean more towards a libertarian, and I do support “conservative” values.&nbsp; That is, limited government, personal responsibility for the decisions you make in life, capitalism, and a culture of law and order so I and my family (and everybody else and
 their families) are safe to reach to achieve whatever dreams we have.&nbsp; I believe every American, black, white, Asian or otherwise, should be able to enjoy a life based on those principles.&nbsp; And the minority people I know have in fact done just that.&nbsp; BTW,
 I’m curious when you described “conservative” as a term of art…I don’t understand what that means and have not heard of that particular political distinction. &nbsp;Unless of course you are referring to
<span lang="EN" style="font-family:Montserrat;color:#212529">Bellows, Sloan, or Wyeth.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jamie, I wanted to set the stage with the above comments as a prelude to acknowledging that I mis-read your last comments.&nbsp; I was rather offended by your comment because of the fact that I did surface and discussed the greater relationship
 between the black community and law enforcement.&nbsp; Clearly Increased crime causes more interaction between law enforcement and the perpetuator, and I think you would agree that that interaction is much less in Hingham or Rocklin than in Chicago or New York.
 &nbsp;Although we indeed did start this conversation regarding the Floyd issue, I thought we had agreed to disagree and were moving on, resulting on my rambling on in a much more global context.….that is, what causes the police violence we all observed and abhorred.&nbsp;
 The left seems to simply place it on racism, an easy out because everybody hates racism, &nbsp;so they don’t have to further explain.&nbsp; That’s what took me to the observations about the greater relationship between law enforcement and the black community in particular.
 And given that we have observed this police violence in several instances, highly documented in the national media, how prevalent is it in our law enforcement agencies nationwide?&nbsp; I hope you agree that 9 deaths of unarmed Black men last year (and 19 of unarmed
 white men), horrible as it is, is not a national trend.&nbsp; Also, why do the perpetrators of the resulting violent rioters and looters in any peaceful demonstration (which I strongly support) believe they have the right to become a mob and destroy property and
 other peoples livelihood, too often in their own neighborhoods and against their own community?&nbsp; What do they think that will accomplish, and if they can articulate that, is it worth it?
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The national discussion seems so one-sided.&nbsp; Obviously reform is needed in police procedures, and I think we all encourage and demand it, but where is the call for reform in the black community?&nbsp; Why are 75% or so of black children born
 to single mothers, significantly impacting the family structure.&nbsp; Why is anybody, black or white, living on welfare because they don’t want to hold a job or get an education?&nbsp; We have programs to help both those particular issues .&nbsp; Why are proportionally
 more blacks committing crimes, therefore engaging more with law enforcement?&nbsp; As you correctly observe, these are not easy questions with simple answers&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding the causes and dynamics behind these issues are, in my view, a lot more productive than
 defunding police forces.&nbsp; I’m not sure we can survive that resulting chaos and anarchy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bear with my ramblings from a crotchety old goat, but one who is so worried about our great nation that I spent my career serving.&nbsp; I have always thought of myself as a change agent, but sometimes I wonder……..<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hugs from us all, take the kids out for an ice cream, better yet a banana split (safely of course) after dinner.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">﻿Dear Uncle Phil: <o:p></o:p></p>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">All of your comments below about “weak intellect” may or may not be true, but they are not my view or what I wrote, and I do not apologize for them. &nbsp;What I actually wrote was: “I understand that ‘black on black crime’ is a favorite topic
 among some conservatives of weak intellect these days, but it has nothing at all to do with what happened to Mr. Floyd.“ Most people I know will readily agree that Mr. Floyd was a troubled man and a criminal — but that is of no relevance to our discussion
 of his murder or Trump’s reaction to it, including Trump’s violation of the constitutional rights of peaceful protestors on Monday.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I do not think of you or my parents as “conservatives”, which is a term of art. &nbsp;I view you as open minded, though GOP-leaning. &nbsp;But perhaps that is wrong. You tell me.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">More importantly, what we have been discussing (Mr. Floyd’s murder and Trump’s reaction to it) has nothing to do with “black on black crime”. &nbsp;It is white on black murder, and it should be condemned in the strongest of terms.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Crime is a serious topic and one Jess and I are steeped in. &nbsp;Yes, I looked at your numbers and in my view they are incorrect and incomplete. &nbsp;But that is a discussion that would take hundreds of pages and a serious analysis of numerous
 factors including socio-economic issues, educational opportunities, societal expectations, red lining, restrictive covenants, and many, many other issues. &nbsp;I did not engage with you on this point because it has nothing to do with what we are discussing (as
 you candidly admitted when you pivoted to that topic) and cannot properly be discussed in a brief email. &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Trump should speak to the nation and sooth it. &nbsp;He should urge peace — not division. He should be like Reagan or Bush or Obama in times of crisis and every fiber of his being should try to heal the nation and bind us together. &nbsp;He has done
 none of these things. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">He should not repeat statements made by a self-avowed Miami racist (“When the looting starts, the shooting starts”). &nbsp;He should not call the “hundreds” of governors (there are only 50) with whom he has spoken names. &nbsp;He should not arrange
 bizarre photo ops that require peaceful protestors to be gassed and beaten. He should not fire anyone who disagrees with him. &nbsp;He should not abandon people who have fought side by side with Americans overseas. He should not have described white supremists
 in Charlottesville as being “good people.” &nbsp;The list goes on and on. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please provide one example of something divisive that President Obama did. I will look forward to that. &nbsp;Or an example of an individual who worked in the Obama administration who was indicted or convicted of a crime. &nbsp;My recollection is
 there have been 11 indicted in the Trump administration (so far), but maybe the number has grown — I haven’t checked in a while. &nbsp;History will treat President Obama as one of the nation’s best; it will treat Trump as a failure and, possibly, as a criminal.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, I, too, am done with this discussion. &nbsp;I hope you have a great weekend. &nbsp;Perhaps we can debate this in person after President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are inaugurated!

<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks Jamie, I think we probably should cease our political discussions, but do notice my comments in red on your email.&nbsp; Because of our apparent weak intellect it’s clear your folks and us simply can’t hold a candle to your opinions.&nbsp;
 I guess we are part of Joe Biden’s 10-15% of the American population that are bad people. . .only about 40 million folks, but hey, there are some good ones says Joe.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Joe Biden and Barak Obama did more to set back the progress of the African American population than any previous administration in my lifetime.&nbsp; And Donald Trump has done more in his tenure so far to advance the economic status of the black
 population than any other Administration in my lifetime.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

cleared them from Lafayette Park for a bizarre photo op in which he held a bible upside down.&nbsp;
</span><span style="color:red">That’s really a significant reason to disagree with what he did?</span>&nbsp;
<span style="color:#1F497D">The newly-minted GOP talking point that the church “had almost burned to the ground” the day before is utterly false.&nbsp;
</span><span style="color:red">Haven’t heard that, but agreed, but as you note violent protesters did set a fire in the church the night before that fortunately was extinguished
</span><span style="color:#1F497D">(In fact, there was a small file in a nursery in the basement.)&nbsp; I do not condone this in any way, shape or form,
</span><span style="color:red">but don’t you agree the secret service and the Capitol Police might be a bit concerned of a repeat</span>
<span style="color:#1F497D">but it pales in comparison to what police did to peaceful protestors.</span>&nbsp;
<span style="color:red">I don’t consider protecting POTUS a trivial thing</span><span style="color:#1F497D">&nbsp; Watch the video.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no ambiguity.</span>&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">But I think that the GOP said it best in a recently-released piece prepared by the Lincoln Project called “America is a War Zone”, which you can watch here:&nbsp;
</span><a href="https://lincolnproject.us/news/war-zone/">https://lincolnproject.us/news/war-zone/</a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">&nbsp; .</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:red">The Lincoln Project is not
 the GOP.&nbsp; If a group of dissatisfied republicans want to advocate against President Trump that’s fine, I support their right to do so and I also have the right to think they are wrong.&nbsp; I listen to them as I listen to CNN and MSNBC, and have not been swayed
 by any of them.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks Jamie, I really appreciate your comments.&nbsp; Bummer with the stomach bug, I guess there’s always the fear of the virus whenever that sort of thing happens.&nbsp; Glad you’re feeling better.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I too wish we lived closer to you all, I vicariously watch the kids grow through your posts on Facebook…you do keep them busy.&nbsp; We haven’t seen your folks for years, not since their last trip here and we spent time in Napa.&nbsp; A couple of
 bottles of good Napa wine does wonders for our disposition these days.&nbsp; Actually we have a pretty decent wine area close to us in the foothills of the Sierra, and Rocklin sits right at the base of the Sierra foothills along I-80.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jamie, while we have disagreements, I too respect your opinion, and indeed seek those opinions that either further strengthen my views or cause me to change them. . . &nbsp;both have occurred.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We are in complete agreement on the value of free expression of our opinions in the form of mass protests…remember we lived through the 60’s and 70’s.&nbsp; I do have different take than you and all I read in the left media on the Trump walk
 to the church.&nbsp; Over the past 30 years or so I have spent time in Washington lobbying for the credit union industry, and on a number of occasions have been sequestered or barred from proceeding because the President (in my case, both Bush and Obama) was passing
 nearby enroute to somewhere.&nbsp; That was a secret service issue, and in my view, an appropriate one to protect the president.&nbsp; I view Lafayette square in the same light.&nbsp; The night before, the church was set afire and looting and violence was prevalent.&nbsp; Although
 those present on the evening of “the walk” apparently were not part of the violent crowed, I can guarantee that the secret service details were not going to take that chance.&nbsp; When the crowd refused to move back, I agree that the secret service Capitol Police
 overreacted.&nbsp; However, no way did President Trump “order tear gas” attacks on the group, but that’s the way it is characterized by the media.&nbsp; The Secret Service runs those type events, not the President.&nbsp; Likewise, the press reported that Trump “Hid in the
 Basement” during the violence the night before.&nbsp; Secret Service took him to the basement as a precaution.&nbsp; We’re not talking about Trump or Obama or Bush, we’re talking about the President of the United States.&nbsp; &nbsp;After his speech in the Rose garden his intent
 was to pay his respects to the Church…in my view a perfectly appropriate act for a President to do.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also, my comments about using the military were consistent with the Presidents’ remarks.&nbsp; “As a last resort” was his term, and that is when the governors fail to maintain law and order to stop
<b>looting, robbery, and in fact now we know several murders</b>.&nbsp; I don’t think we’re there yet, and I pray we never get there, but unless this lawlessness is contained and stopped we are headed for anarchy in this country.&nbsp; Last resort means exactly that…all
 previous attempts have been exhausted and there is no other option.&nbsp; <b>In no way should the military be used to quell peaceful protests</b>, but the media simply won’t make that nuance in reporting what happened that evening.&nbsp; I wish he would not have done
 it, but don’t misinterpret the intent.&nbsp; BTW, although you’re the lawyer, I heard last night that the insurrection act has in fact been exercised 18 times in our history, so, assuming that is correct, &nbsp;with respect to General Mattis he is dead wrong.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now lets get to the source of the problem, alleged police “systemic racism against black men”.&nbsp; Most of us interact with people of many races daily without conflict or incident. &nbsp;Our friends, and even spouses, have skin colors different
 than ours, as do our teachers, doctors, and nurses. Like Tom Selleck, this isn’t my first rodeo and throughout my 30 year military career plus another 30 in retirement I cannot cite one example of overt racism that I personally observed. I have met black people
 with whom I disagree and don’t like, but that’s not because they are black, it’s because I don’t like them.&nbsp; I’m not naïve to differences, and my life experience has put me in contact with a huge variety of cultures, races, living and working environments
 that have exposed me to a variety of possibilities and opportunities to observe.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been told by the media daily that racism is prevalent throughout the country, but I don’t see it. That’s not to say there is not racism among humans, there certainly
 is.&nbsp; But to allege that this country is systemically engaging in black racism is, in my opinion, false.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And to charge somebody as being a racist because of an off-handed remark is wrong.&nbsp; Case in point, we have a sports reporter in our area, outstanding professional, well regarded, &nbsp;who has been the voice of the Sacramento Kings since the
 mid-80’s and has his own sports radio show.&nbsp; Demarcus Cousins tweeted him, asking what he thought of BLM, and his answer was, ALL LIVES MATTER – EVERY ONE (in caps).&nbsp; That apparently has become so offensive and considered a put-down to BLM that his company
 fired him as the Kings spokesman and cancelled his daily radio show, specifically for that tweet.&nbsp; He is now considered a racist.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Floyd murder is disgusting and the officers involved should and will be held accountable.&nbsp; But please don’t draw from that incident (and several others) that the entire institution is racist.&nbsp; That’s such an easy, emotional based fallacy.&nbsp;
 I read recently (WSJ, 3 Jun, Opinion, Heather MacDonald) that in 2019 police officers fatally shot 1,004 people, most of whom were armed or otherwise dangerous.&nbsp; African-Americans were about a quarter of those killed, a ratio that has held steady since 2015.&nbsp;
 That share of black victims is less than what the black crime rate would predict, since police shootings are a function of how often officers encounter armed and violent suspects.&nbsp; In 2018 (the latest year for which such data have been published), African-American
 made up 53% of known homicide offenders in the U.S. and commit about 60% of robberies, though they are 13% of the population. The police fatally shot nine un-armed blacks and 19 un-armed whites in 2019, according to a Washington Post database, down from 38
 and 32 in 2015.&nbsp; In 2018 there were 7,407 black homicide victims.&nbsp; Assuming a comparable number of victims last year, the 9 unarmed victims of police shootings in 2019 &nbsp;represent 0.1% of all African-Americans killed in 2019. &nbsp;Hardly a case of police systemic
 racism. &nbsp;Put simply, blacks kill other blacks &nbsp;more than police kill them.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rather than label police as racist and attack the institution of law enforcement, let’s address why these statistics are as they are, and what can we as a nation do about it.&nbsp; If you have statistics to refute these please let me know, it’s
 only one source.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jamie, I have blabbered on way too long, my apologies, but a lot of it just became a stream of consciousness.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, I am neither a “never Trumper” nor a “Trump Supporter”.&nbsp; I dislike the man, but I like most of the policies
 he established and changed during his tenure so far, and to my mind hope he continues.&nbsp; More importantly, I dislike the policies and practices of the Democratic party.&nbsp; Convince me otherwise.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hugs to the kiddies and your bride.&nbsp; Your kids at their age have been to more concerts than I have in my 80 years!<o:p></o:p></p>

 I assumed, apparently correctly, that we both agree that rioting, looting, property damage, and attacking police officers is always wrong and never acceptable.&nbsp; Full stop.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black">But peaceful protest – of the type that was happening in Lafayette Square on Monday – is always acceptable and never wrong.&nbsp; It is protected by our Constitution,
 which you and I have both sworn an oath to uphold.&nbsp; (In my case, when I became employed by the federal government in 1992.)&nbsp; It is a bedrock of the American experiment. &nbsp;It is why American Nazis are permitted to march through Skokie, Illinois, spouting rhetoric

 joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less

 But we both know that he won’t do that.&nbsp; He is doing his best to divide this country in an attempt to win an election.&nbsp; But I believe in America; I believe in what this great country stands for; I believe in that which you dedicated your life to defending;

<p class="MsoNormal">Jamie, I just find it quite unbelievable that your outrage is towards the President walking across the street rather than the anarchy we see nightly on our TV.&nbsp; We are all outraged by the killing in Minnesota, and we all support peaceful
 demonstrations to bring grievances to the forefront.&nbsp; What is disgusting is the rioting and looting and absolute disregard for personal property and personal safety in all these neighborhoods and cities.&nbsp; The black community is collectively shooting themselves
 in the foot and turning a good part of this country against them, further exacerbating the problem.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’m a military man Jamie, and I support using whatever force is necessary to maintain law and order, up to and including using the full force of our armed forces to maintain the peace.&nbsp; We can and should address the abuses, and there are
 probably many, that are causing these riots.&nbsp; Burning down our cities is not part of the solution.&nbsp;
